<h3>John Wick Series</h3>
<p>Even though I just recently watched all of the John Wick movies, they are definitely some of my favorites.</p>

<h3>Cars Series</h3>
<p>This is an all time classic for Disney. If you don't like these, you don't know good movies.</p>

<h3>Any Batman movie</h3>
<p>Come on now, Batman is the literal goat. Nobody is better, NO CAP. </p>
